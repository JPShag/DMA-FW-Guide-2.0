         if (bar_hit[0]) begin
           case (addr_offset)
             16'h0000: data_out <= reg0;
             16'h0004: data_out <= reg1;
             // Additional registers
             default: data_out <= 32'h0;
           endcase
         end
         ```

3. **Implement Address Decoding Logic:**

   - **Calculate Address Offsets:**
     - Use the incoming address to calculate offsets within the BAR.
       ```verilog
       addr_offset = incoming_address - bar_base_address[0];
       ```

   - **Handle Data Transfers:**
     - Implement logic for read and write operations.
