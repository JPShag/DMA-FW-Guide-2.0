The primary goal of this guide is to help developers create custom firmware to emulate PCIe devices using FPGA-based DMA hardware. The first part of this guide focuses on the basics, walking through the essential steps for firmware development, device information gathering, environment setup, and initial firmware customization. This will lay the groundwork for more advanced custom firmware development covered in **Part 2**.

### **1.2 Target Audience**

This guide is intended for:

- **Beginners**: People new to firmware development, FPGA programming, or PCIe device emulation.
- **Firmware Developers**: Engineers creating custom firmware for testing, emulation, or specific hardware functionality.
- **Hardware Engineers**: Professionals working on hardware design and testing using FPGAs.
- **Security Researchers**: Individuals leveraging hardware-based security tools and custom emulated devices.

---

# **2. Key Definitions**

Understanding the following key concepts is essential for effective firmware development:

- **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: A feature that allows hardware devices to access the systemâ€™s memory independently of the CPU, often used for fast data transfers.
- **FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)**: A programmable integrated circuit that allows developers to create custom hardware designs.
- **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)**: A fast data transfer interface used for connecting hardware devices to a computer's motherboard.
- **TLP (Transaction Layer Packet)**: The data packet format used in PCIe communication, containing control and data information.
- **BAR (Base Address Register)**: Registers in PCIe devices that specify the memory regions mapped to system memory for device communication.
- **Device Serial Number (DSN)**: A unique identifier used by some devices for enhanced identification and emulation accuracy.

- **Kernel DMA Protection**: Disable Kernel DMA protection features to ensure unrestricted memory access.
- **PCIe Slot Requirements**: Ensure that the FPGA card is installed in a compatible PCIe slot (e.g., x1, x4, x16) that matches the cardâ€™s capabilities.

### **3.3 System Requirements**

To successfully develop, test, and run custom firmware, the following system setup is recommended:

- **Host System**:
  - **Processor**: Multi-core CPU (Intel i5/i7 or equivalent)
  - **Memory**: Minimum 16GB of RAM
  - **Storage**: SSD with at least 100GB of free space
  - **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or a compatible Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian
- **Peripheral Devices**:
  - **JTAG Programmer**: Required for flashing firmware onto the FPGA
  - **Available PCIe Slot**: Ensure your system has an available PCIe slot for the FPGA card

# **7. Initial Firmware Customization**

### **7.1 Modifying Configuration Space**

The PCIe configuration space defines how the FPGA is identified by the host system. To spoof the donor device, youâ€™ll need to customize this space with the correct values.

1. **Open `pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv`** in Visual Studio Code.

2. **Modify Device and Vendor IDs**
   - Replace the default Device ID and Vendor ID with the values from the donor device:
     ```verilog
     cfg_deviceid <= 16'h1234; // Replace with donor Device ID
     cfg_vendorid <= 16'hABCD; // Replace with donor Vendor ID
     ```

3. **Modify Subsystem IDs**
   - Update the Subsystem IDs to match the donor device:
     ```verilog
     cfg_subsysid <= 16'h5678;  // Replace with donor Subsystem ID
     cfg_subsysvid <= 16'hABCD; // Typically same as Vendor ID
     ```

4. **Set Revision IDs and Class Codes**
   - Set the device class and revision:
     ```verilog
     cfg_rev_id <= 8'h01;  // Replace with donor Revision ID
     cfg_class_code <= 24'h020000; // Example for Network Controller
     ```

5. **Configure BARs**
   - Define the number and size of the Base Address Registers (BARs):
     ```verilog
     cfg_bar_0 <= 32'hFFFFFFF0; // 32-bit Memory BAR
     ```

### **7.2 Inserting the Device Serial Number (DSN)**

1. **Locate DSN Configuration**
   - Insert the donor deviceâ€™s serial number:
     ```verilog
     cfg_dsn <= 64'h01000000684CE000; // Replace with donor DSN
     ```

2. **Handle Missing DSN**
   - If the donor device does not have a DSN, use zeros or generate a unique DSN:
     ```verilog
     cfg_dsn <= 64'h0000000000000000;
     ```

# **8. Vivado Project Setup and Customization**

### **8.1 Generating Vivado Project Files**

1. **Open Vivado**

2. **Launch the Tcl Console**
   - In the Vivado interface, open the Tcl Console from the toolbar or navigation menu.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the PCILeech project:
     ```tcl
     cd C:/path/to/pcileech-fpga/PCIeSquirrel
     ```

4. **Generate the Vivado Project**
   - Run the following command to generate the project:
     ```tcl
     source vivado_generate_project_squirrel.tcl -notrace
     ```

### **8.2 Modifying IP Blocks**

1. **Open the PCIe IP Core Configuration**
   - In Vivado, navigate to the **Sources** pane and find `pcileech_squirrel_top`.
   - Locate the **`pcie_7x_0`** module, right-click it, and choose **Customize IP**.

2. **Modify Device and Vendor IDs**
   - In the customization window, enter the correct Device ID and Vendor ID from the donor device.

3. **Configure BARs**
   - Set the correct number, type, and size of BARs based on the donor deviceâ€™s configuration.

4. **Set Revision and Class Codes**
   - Ensure that the revision and class codes match the donor device.

5. **Lock the IP Core**
   - Lock the IP core to prevent Vivado from overwriting these changes during synthesis:
     ```tcl
     set_property is_managed false [get_files pcie_7x_0.xci]
     ```

   - Use **Device Manager** (Windows) or `lspci` (Linux) to check if the FPGA is detected as the donor device.

2. **Test Device Functionality

**
   - Depending on the device, perform basic tests such as checking network connectivity (for network cards) or accessing storage (for storage devices).

3. **Test Performance**
   - Use benchmarking tools to verify that the device performs as expected, comparing results with the original hardware.

# **10. Troubleshooting**

### **10.1 Device Detection Issues**

If the host system does not detect the FPGA, try the following:

- **Check Physical Connections**: Ensure the FPGA card is properly seated in the PCIe slot.
- **Review Configuration Settings**: Verify the correctness of the Device ID, Vendor ID, and BAR configurations.
- **BIOS/UEFI Settings**: Ensure that DMA protection features are disabled and that the system supports external DMA devices.

### **10.2 Memory Mapping and BAR Configuration Errors**

If you experience issues with memory mapping or accessing the device:

- **Verify BAR Sizes and Addresses**: Double-check that the BAR sizes and address ranges match those of the donor device.
- **Memory Alignment**: Ensure that BARs are properly aligned to the system memory.
- **Resolve Overlapping BARs**: Avoid assigning overlapping memory regions to different BARs.

### **10.3 DMA Performance and TLP Errors**

For performance or data transfer issues:

- **Optimize FIFO Sizes**: Adjust FIFO buffers for better data handling.
- **TLP Payload Sizes**: Set the maximum TLP payload size to match the donor deviceâ€™s specifications.
