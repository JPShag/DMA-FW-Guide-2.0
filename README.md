# **11. Advanced Firmware Customization**

## **11.1 Configuring PCIe Parameters for Emulation**

The accuracy of emulation greatly depends on how well the FPGA-based device replicates the donor deviceâ€™s PCIe configuration, link speed, and width. Fine-tuning these settings will allow the host system to interact with the FPGA as if it were the original hardware.

### **Setting PCIe Link Speed and Width**

1. **Open `pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv`** in your editor.

2. **Locate the PCIe Link Speed and Width Configurations**:
   - Ensure the values for link speed and width are consistent with the donor device.

    ```verilog
    pcie_link_speed <= 4'b0010;   // PCIe Gen2 (5 GT/s)
    pcie_link_width <= 8'b00000100; // x4 lanes
    ```

   **Example**: For a Gen2 x4 PCIe device, set the link speed to `4'b0010` and the width to `8'b00000100`.

### **Configuring Capability Pointers**

PCIe capability pointers are essential for ensuring the host system can access advanced PCIe features like MSI/MSI-X, power management, and error reporting.

1. **Set Capability Pointer**:
    - Adjust the capability pointer to match that of the donor device.

    ```verilog
    capability_pointer <= 8'h40;  // Starting location for PCIe capabilities
    ```

2. **Extended Capabilities**:
    - You can extend this section by adding or modifying support for features like Advanced Error Reporting (AER) or Latency Tolerance Reporting (LTR).

    ```verilog
    AER_CAP_VERSION <= 4'b0001;  // Enable AER support
    ```

---

## **11.2 Adjusting BARs and Memory Mapping**

Base Address Registers (BARs) allow PCIe devices to map their internal memory to system memory. Proper configuration of BARs is critical for the host system to communicate with the emulated device.

### **Setting BAR Sizes**

1. **Open `pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv`**.

2. **Modify the BAR Size Values** to match the donor deviceâ€™s BARs.

   **Example**: For a 16KB BAR0:
   ```verilog
   bar0_size <= 32'h00004000;  // 16KB BAR0
   ```

3. **Repeat for Additional BARs** as needed for BAR1, BAR2, etc.

### **Defining BAR Address Spaces**

1. Ensure BAR address spaces are **contiguous** and donâ€™t overlap. Overlapping BARs can cause memory mapping errors in the host system.

   ```verilog
   bar0_addr <= 32'hF0000000;  // Example BAR0 address
   bar1_addr <= 32'hF0004000;  // Example BAR1 address
   ```

2. **Align Memory Regions**: Make sure BARs are aligned according to the donor deviceâ€™s configuration.

---

## **11.3 Emulating Device Power Management and Interrupts**

Properly emulating power management and interrupts is crucial for seamless system integration. The host system expects certain behaviors from the device when it transitions between power states or handles interrupts.

### **Power Management (PM) Configuration**

1. **Set Power Management Capabilities**:
   - Adjust the power management settings to emulate the donor device's power features.

   ```verilog
   PM_CAP_VERSION <= 4'b0011;     // Power Management version 3.0
   PM_CAP_D1SUPPORT <= 1'b1;      // Support for D1 power state
   PM_CAP_D2SUPPORT <= 1'b0;      // No support for D2
   ```

2. **Power State Transitions**:
   - Implement logic for transitioning between power states (D0, D1, D3) as per the donor deviceâ€™s capabilities.

### **MSI/MSI-X (Interrupts) Configuration**

1. **Enable MSI or MSI-X** in `pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv`.

   ```verilog
   MSI_CAP_64_BIT_ADDR_CAPABLE <= 1'b1;  // Enable 64-bit address for MSI
   cfg_interrupt <= 1'b1;                // Enable MSI interrupts
   ```

2. **Route Interrupt Signals** correctly to ensure that the host system receives the expected interrupt behavior from the emulated device.

   ```verilog
   assign cfg_interrupt_di = cfg_int_di;
   assign cfg_interrupt_assert = cfg_int_assert;
   ```

---

# **12. Emulating Device-Specific Capabilities**

Many devices include advanced capabilities beyond standard PCIe behavior, such as custom power management or proprietary features. Emulating these device-specific capabilities enhances the fidelity of the emulation.

## **12.1 Implementing Advanced PCIe Capabilities**

### **Advanced Error Reporting (AER)**

1. **Enable AER** to match the donor deviceâ€™s configuration:
   - Advanced Error Reporting (AER) allows the device to report and log PCIe errors.

    ```verilog
    AER_CAP_VERSION <= 4'b0001;  // AER capability version 1
    AER_CAP_NEXTPTR <= 8'h00;    // No next capability
    ```

### **Link Speed Negotiation**

Ensure that the emulated device supports dynamic link speed negotiation as seen in the donor device.

1. **Set the PCIe Link Speed**:
   - The FPGA should

 negotiate the link speed based on host system capabilities.

    ```verilog
    pcie_link_speed <= 4'b0010;  // Gen2 speed (5 GT/s)
    ```

---

## **12.2 Emulating Vendor-Specific Features**

Certain devices have proprietary features unique to the vendor. These must be carefully implemented to ensure that the FPGA behaves identically to the original device.

### **Capture Vendor-Specific TLPs**

Use PCIe traffic analysis tools (covered in [Section 14.2](#142-pcie-traffic-analysis-tools)) to monitor TLPs and identify vendor-specific behaviors.

### **Implement Vendor-Specific Registers**

Create custom logic to handle any vendor-specific registers or commands.

# **13. Transaction Layer Packet (TLP) Emulation**

TLPs are the building blocks of PCIe communication. Accurately crafting TLPs ensures smooth interactions between the host system and the emulated device.

## **13.1 Understanding and Capturing TLPs**

### **TLP Components**

A TLP consists of three key components:
- **Header**: Contains control information such as address, length, and type of transaction.
- **Data Payload**: The actual data being transferred.
- **Tail**: Includes additional control information and checksums.

### **Capturing TLPs**

1. **Use PCIe traffic analysis tools** (e.g., **Wireshark** with PCIe extensions or **Teledyne LeCroy Telescan PE**) to monitor TLP traffic from the donor device.

2. **Analyze TLP Patterns**:
   - Look for recurring TLP patterns, such as memory reads/writes or configuration accesses.

---

## **13.2 Crafting Custom TLPs for Specific Operations**

Once you understand the structure of TLPs, you can craft custom TLPs to match specific operations from the donor device.

### **Memory Write TLP Example**

```verilog
// TLP for Memory Write
tlp_header <= {2'b10, 5'b00000, 3'b000, 1'b0, 1'b0, 2'b00, 10'b0000000001};  // Fmt, Type, etc.
tlp_address <= 64'h0000000012345678;  // Target address
tlp_data <= 32'hDEADBEEF;             // Data payload
```

### **Configuration Access TLP Example**

```verilog
// TLP for Configuration Write
tlp_header <= {2'b10, 5'b00101, 3'b000, 1'b0, 1'b0, 2'b00, 10'b0000000001};  // Fmt, Type, etc.
tlp_address <= 32'h00000010;            // Configuration register address
tlp_data <= 32'h00000001;               // Data to write
```
