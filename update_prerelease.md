## **2. Key Definitions**

Understanding the terminology is crucial for effectively following this guide. Below are key definitions related to PCIe, DMA, and device emulation:

- **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: A capability that allows hardware devices to read from or write to system memory directly, without CPU intervention, enabling high-speed data transfers.
- **TLP (Transaction Layer Packet)**: The fundamental unit of communication in the PCIe architecture, encapsulating control and data information.
- **BAR (Base Address Register)**: Registers in PCIe devices that define memory and I/O address regions, mapping device memory into the system memory space.
- **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)**: A reconfigurable integrated circuit that can be programmed to perform specific hardware functions.
- **MSI/MSI-X (Message Signaled Interrupts)**: Mechanisms used by PCIe devices to send interrupts to the CPU without using traditional interrupt lines.
- **Device Serial Number (DSN)**: A unique identifier associated with a specific device, often used for advanced device identification.
- **PCIe Configuration Space**: A standardized memory area where PCIe devices provide information about themselves and configure operational parameters.
- **Donor Device**: A PCIe hardware device used to extract configuration and identification details for the purpose of emulating its behavior on an FPGA.

  2. **Set Maximum Read Request Size**:

     - Similarly, set the **Max Read Request Size Supported**.

  3. **Adjust Firmware Parameters**:

     - In `pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv`, ensure that these values are reflected in the firmware:
       ```verilog
       max_payload_size_supported <= 3'bZZZ; // Replace ZZZ with appropriate value
       max_read_request_size_supported <= 3'bWWW; // Replace WWW with appropriate value
       ```

  4. **Save Changes**:

     - Save the file after making the adjustments.

### **8.2 Adjusting BARs and Memory Mapping**

BARs define the memory regions that the device exposes to the host.

     - Define the address ranges and implement the logic to handle accesses to the BARs.
     - **Example**:
       ```verilog
       always_comb begin
         if (bar_hit[0]) begin
           // Handle BAR0 access
         end else if (bar_hit[1]) begin
           // Handle BAR1 access
         end
         // Continue for other BARs
       end
       ```

  3. **Implement Address Decoding Logic**:

     - Ensure that the firmware correctly decodes the BAR addresses and routes the transactions appropriately.

  4. **Save Changes**:
